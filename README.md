### About

This package accesses the exported C-level functions of the
[xts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts) package. By using
[Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/), it permits creation of
[xts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts) objects directly at the C++
level, and via access to the [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts)
core functions also make some of these core operations available from their C
API level.

### Status

The package is still mostly a proof-of-concept and illustration---but builds
and works reliably, and has been on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) for
some time.
